backToMain, reloadLvl and main menu work by placeing them on buttons

bigClipper, pruning, laser all wrok the same. You must place a a collider (isTrigger) and a rigidbody. They all must be tagged either stay or behead

destroyTheFallen needs a collider (istrigger), and 2 buttons. the reload and the back to greenhouse button. You need the bad ones to be greater or equal to the static number for the greenhouse button to show up. If too much fall then the reload button will show up.

You just need to attach a camera to followmouse and it shall follow the mouse

sceneHandler u just need to add the clickabele objects and the objects its switching to after

carryOn, controlLvl and death shall not be named ;_;
